    <h1>How to make Nitroglycerin</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Nitroglycerin is a high explosive, with an incredibly unstable nature. It can explode for the most minute reasons, such as a change of one or two degrees in temperature, or a minor shock. Be-cause of nitroglycerin's unstable nature, I would suggest that only people with an extensive background training in both cheinistry and explosives try this procedure.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cotton</li>
        <li>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) &mdash; 2%</li>
        <li>Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) &mdash; concentrated</li>
        <li>Nitric acid (HNO₃) &mdash; concentrated</li>
        <li>Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) &mdash; 2%</li>
        <li>Water (H₂O)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a 75-milliliter beaker, to the 13-m1. level, with fuming red nitric acid, of 98 percent concentration.</li>
        <li>Place beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below MITI temperature.</li>
        <li>After it is cooled, add to it three times the amount of fuming sulfuric acid (99 percent H2SO4). In other words, add to the now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 milliliters of fuming sulfuric acid. When mixing any acids, always do it slowly and carefully to avoid splattering.</li>
        <li>When the two are mixed, lower their temperature, by adding more ice to the bath, to about 10 or 15 degrees Centigrade. This can be measured by using a mercury-op-erated Centigrade thermometer.</li>
        <li>When the acid solution has cooled to the desired tem-perature, it is ready for the glycerin. The glycerin must be added in small amounts using a medicine dropper. Gly-cerin is added, slowly and carefully, until the entire surface of the acid is covered with it.</li>
        <li>This is a dangerous point, since the nitration will take place as soon as the glycerin is added. The nitration will produce heat, so the solution must be kept below 30 de-grees C. If the solution should go above 30 degrees, the beaker should be taken out of the ice bath and the solution should be carefully poured directly into the ice bath, since this will prevent an explosion.</li>
        <li>For about the first ten minutes of the nitration, the mixture should be gently stirred. In a normal reaction, the nitroglycerin will form as a layer on top of the acid solu-tion, while the sulfuric acid will absorb the excess water.</li>
        <li>After the nitration has taken place and the nitrogly-cerin has formed at the top of the solution, the entire beak-er should be transferred very slowly and carefully to another beaker of water. When this is done, the nitroglycerin will settle to the bottom, so that most of the acid solution can be drained away.</li>
        <li>After removing as much acid as possible without dis-turbing the nitroglycerin, remove the nitroglycerin with an nedmpper and place it in a bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate) solution. The sodium bicarbonate is an alkali and will neutralize much of the acid remaining. This pro-cess should be repeated as many timcs as necessary using blue litmus paper to check for the presence of acid. The remaining acid only makes the nitroglycerin more unstable than it normally is.</li>
        <li>The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from the bicarbonate. This is done with an eye dropper, slowly and carefully. The usual test to see if nitration has been suc-cessful is to place one drop of the nitroglycerin on a metal plate and ignite it. If it is true nitroglycerin, it will burn with a clear blue flame.</li>
        Caution: Nitroglycerin is extremely sensitive to decomposition, heating, dropping, or jarring, and may explode even if left undisturbed and cool. Know what you are doing before you do it.
